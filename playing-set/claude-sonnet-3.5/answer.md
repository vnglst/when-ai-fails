# Claude Sonnet 3.5

I'll analyze this Set layout and find all valid Sets. Let me go through each potential combination systematically.

First, let me review what makes a valid Set: three cards where for each attribute (shape, number, color, shading), either all three cards have the same value or all three have different values.

Here are all the Sets I found:

1. Cards 1, 6, 11:
   All ovals/squiggles/ovals (all different)
   All 2s (all same)
   All red (all same)
   All solid/solid/hashed (all different)

2. Cards 3, 7, 9:
   Ovals/diamonds/diamonds (all different)
   2/3/3 (all different)
   Green/green/red (all different)
   Solid/outlined/hashed (all different)

3. Cards 3, 8, 12:
   Ovals/squiggles/ovals (all different)
   2/3/3 (all different)
   All green (all same)
   Solid/outlined/solid (all different)

4. Cards 2, 4, 9:
   Oval/squiggle/diamond (all different)
   1/1/3 (all different)
   Purple/green/red (all different)
   Hashed/outlined/hashed (all different)

5. Cards 2, 5, 11:
   Oval/diamond/oval (all different)
   1/3/2 (all different)
   Purple/green/red (all different)
   All hashed (all same)

6. Cards 4, 9, 10:
   Squiggle/diamond/oval (all different)
   1/3/1 (all different)
   Green/red/purple (all different)
   Outlined/hashed/outlined (all different)

That's all the valid Sets present in this layout.
