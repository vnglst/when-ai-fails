```
<thinking>
Okay, let's see. I need to find all possible Sets in this layout. A Set is three cards where each attribute (shape, number, color, shading) is either all the same or all different across the three. So I have to check every combination of three cards and see if they meet that condition for all four attributes.

First, let me list out all the cards with their attributes to have a clear view:

Top row:

1. O2RS (Oval, 2, Red, Solid)

2. O1PH (Oval, 1, Purple, Hashed)

3. O2GS (Oval, 2, Green, Solid)

4. S1GO (Squiggle, 1, Green, Outlined)

Middle row:

5. D3GH (Diamond, 3, Green, Hashed)

6. S2RS (Squiggle, 2, Red, Solid)

7. D2GO (Diamond, 2, Green, Outlined)

8. S2GO (Squiggle, 2, Green, Outlined)

Bottom row:

9. D3RH (Diamond, 3, Red, Hashed)

10. O1PO (Oval, 1, Purple, Outlined)

11. O2RH (Oval, 2, Red, Hashed)

12. O3GS (Oval, 3, Green, Solid)

So there are 12 cards. The total possible combinations of three cards would be C(12,3) = 220. That's a lot. But maybe there's a smarter way than checking all 220. Let's think about how attributes can form a set. For each attribute in the three cards, they must be all same or all different. Let's tackle each attribute one by one and see if that can help narrow down possibilities.

Let me start by looking for possible patterns. For example, maybe start with the shape. If three cards have all same shape or all different. Let's see:

Looking at the shapes:

Cards with Diamond: 5,7,9

Oval: 1,2,3,10,11,12

Squiggle:4,6,8

So maybe check if there's a set within the same shape first. But sets can also be across different shapes. Alternatively, maybe look for all same or all different in each attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps group cards by their attributes and look for combinations where each attribute is either all same or all different.

Let me think. Let's start with possible triples that could form a set. Let's pick three cards and check each attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps start by looking for triples where for each attribute, they are all same or all different. Let's take an example. Let's try card 1, 2, 3. Let's check:

Shape: All Ovals. Same. Good.

Number: 2,1,2. Not all same. Are they all different? 1,2,2. No. So number is not all same nor all different. So this can't be a set.

How about cards 1,2,4? Let's check:

Shape: O, O, S. Not all same or all different (two O, one S). So shape fails. So no.

Cards 1,5,9. Let's check:

Shape: O, D, D. Not all same or different. So no.

Wait, maybe look for a set where all attributes are same except one, but that's not the rule. Each attribute must be all same or all different.

Let me try another approach. Let's check each attribute separately.

First, let's check for possible number attributes. The numbers are 1,2,3. For a set, the numbers must be all same or all different. So possible number combinations are either three of the same (like 1,1,1; 2,2,2; 3,3,3) or 1,2,3. So perhaps first look for groups that have either all same numbers or 1,2,3.

Similarly for color: R, G, P. So either all same color, or one of each.

Shading: S, O, H. Same here.

Shape: D, O, S. All same or all different.

So maybe start by looking for trios where numbers are either all same or 1,2,3, and similarly for other attributes.

Alternatively, check each possible trio step by step. Let's try some.

Let's check the top row first. Cards 1,2,3,4.

Check 1,2,3: Shapes are all O. Color: R, P, G. All different. Number: 2,1,2. Not same nor different. So invalid. Shading: S, H, S. Two S and one H. Not same or different. So no.

1,2,4: Shapes O, O, S. Not same or different. So invalid.

1,3,4: Shapes O, O, S. Same problem.

2,3,4: Shapes O, O, S. No.

How about cards 1,4,7? Let's see.

Card1: O2RS

Card4: S1GO

Card7: D2GO

Shapes: O, S, D. All different. Good.

Numbers: 2,1,2. Not same or different. So numbers are 2,1,2. Not valid. So this trio fails.

Hmm.

How about middle row, cards 5,6,7.

5: D3GH

6: S2RS

7: D2GO

Shapes: D, S, D. Not all same or different.

Numbers:3,2,2. Not same or different.

So no.

How about cards 5,6,8.

5: D3GH

6: S2RS

8: S2GO

Shapes: D, S, S. Not all same/different.

Numbers:3,2,2. Same as above. Not.

Maybe look for trios where numbers are all same. For example, three cards with number 1. Let's see which cards have number 1:

Card2: O1PH

Card4: S1GO

Card10: O1PO

So three cards: 2,4,10. Let's check this trio.

Shapes: O, S, O. Not all same or different. So invalid.

Another number 1 trio is not possible. So maybe number 2. Cards with number 2:

1,3,6,7,8,11.

That's six cards. So combinations here. But it's a lot. Maybe pick three and check.

Take 1,3,6.

Card1: O2RS

Card3: O2GS

Card6: S2RS

Shapes: O, O, S. Not all same or different.

Color: R, G, R. Not same or different. So invalid.

Take 1,6,7:

Card1: O2RS

Card6: S2RS

Card7: D2GO

Shapes: O, S, D. All different. Good.

Numbers: all 2. Same. Good.

Color: R, R, G. Two R and one G. Not same or different. So invalid.

Shading: S, S, O. Two S and one O. Invalid.

So this trio is invalid.

How about 1,6,11.

Card1: O2RS

Card6: S2RS

Card11: O2RH

Shapes: O, S, O. Not all same or different.

Colors: R, R, R. All same. Good.

Numbers: 2,2,2. Same. Good.

Shading: S, S, H. Two S and one H. Not same or different. So shading fails. So invalid.

Another approach: Let's look for all different attributes. For example, a set where all four attributes are different. But that's possible only if each attribute is all different. Let's see.

For example, shapes D, O, S. Numbers 1,2,3. Colors R, G, P. Shading S, O, H.

But such a combination would require each attribute to be different. Let's check if any trio meets this.

Take cards 2,5,12.

Card2: O1PH (Oval,1,Purple,Hashed)

Card5: D3GH (Diamond,3,Green,Hashed)

Card12: O3GS (Oval,3,Green,Solid)

Wait, shape of card12 is O, same as card2. So shapes are O, D, O. Not all different. So invalid.

How about 4,5,9.

Card4: S1GO (Squiggle,1,Green,Outlined)

Card5: D3GH (Diamond,3,Green,Hashed)

Card9: D3RH (Diamond,3,Red,Hashed)

Shapes: S, D, D. Not all different.

Hmm. Maybe cards 2, 7, 9.

Card2: O1PH (O,1,P,H)

Card7: D2GO (D,2,G,O)

Card9: D3RH (D,3,R,H)

Shapes: O, D, D. Not all different. So invalid.

How about 2,5,7.

Card2: O1PH

Card5: D3GH

Card7: D2GO

Shapes: O, D, D. Not all different. So no.

Another trio: 4, 5, 10.

Card4: S1GO

Card5: D3GH

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: S, D, O. All different. Good.

Numbers:1,3,1. Not same or different. So numbers are 1,3,1: two 1s and one 3. Not valid.

So that trio fails.

Alternatively, cards 2,5,10.

Card2: O1PH

Card5: D3GH

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: O, D, O. Not all different. So invalid.

Hmm. Let's think of other trios. Let's try cards 5,9,12.

Card5: D3GH

Card9: D3RH

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: D, D, O. Not all same or different.

Numbers:3,3,3. Same.

Colors: G, R, G. Not same or different.

Shading: H, H, S. Not same or different.

So invalid.

Another idea: Let's check for all same color. For example, green. Cards with color G:

3 (O2GS),5 (D3GH),7 (D2GO),8 (S2GO),12 (O3GS).

So possible trios among these. Let's check 3,5,7.

Card3: O2GS (O,2,G,S)

Card5: D3GH (D,3,G,H)

Card7: D2GO (D,2,G,O)

Shapes: O, D, D. Not all same or different.

Numbers:2,3,2. Not same or different.

Shading: S, H, O. All different. But since the other attributes don't meet the criteria, this trio is invalid.

How about 5,7,8.

Card5: D3GH

Card7: D2GO

Card8: S2GO

Shapes: D, D, S. Not all same or different.

Numbers:3,2,2. Not same or different.

So no.

Another trio: 3,8,12.

Card3: O2GS

Card8: S2GO

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: O, S, O. Not all same or different.

Numbers:2,2,3. Not same or different.

Hmm. Maybe this isn't working. Let's try another approach. Let's pick a card and see what other cards can form a set with it.

Take Card1: O2RS.

To form a set with Card1, we need two other cards such that for each attribute:

- Shape: Either all O or all different (D, O, S). But since Card1 is O, the other two could be O, O (but then all same) or different shapes. Wait, no. For a set, each attribute must be all same or all different. So if Card1 is O, then the other two must be O (all same) or D and S (all different).

Similarly for other attributes.

Let's go through each attribute for Card1:

Shape: O. So the other two must be O, O or D, S.

Number: 2. So other two must be 2,2 or 1,3.

Color: R. So other two must be R, R or G, P.

Shading: S. So other two must be S, S or O, H.

So to form a set with Card1, the other two cards must satisfy each of these attributes being all same or all different. Let's look for possible combinations.

Let's start with shape. Let's first check if we can find two other O cards that meet the other attributes.

Possible O cards: 1,2,3,10,11,12.

So excluding 1, the others are 2,3,10,11,12.

For number: Card1 is 2. So for numbers to be same, the other two must be 2. Or different, 1 and 3.

Color: R. So other two must be R, R or G and P.

Shading: S. Other two must be S, S or O and H.

Let's see if there are two other O cards where numbers are all 2. Cards 1,3,11.

Card3: O2GS (G, S). Card11: O2RH (R, H). So colors for these three: R (card1), G (card3), R (card11). Wait, card11 is R. So color would be R, G, R. That's two R and one G. Not all same or different. So invalid.

Alternatively, numbers 1,2,3. So find two O cards with number 1 and 3. Cards 2 (1), 12 (3). Let's check Card1 (2), Card2 (1), Card12 (3).

Shapes: all O. Good.

Numbers: 2,1,3. All different. Good.

Colors: R (card1), Purple (card2), Green (card12). All different. Good.

Shading: Solid (card1), Hashed (card2), Solid (card12). Shading: S, H, S. Two S and one H. Not all same or different. So shading fails. So this trio is invalid.

How about colors all same? For Card1, color R. Let's see if there are two other O cards with R. Card1, 11 is O2RH (R). So Card1,11, and another O card with R? But looking at O cards, only 1 and 11 have R. So two cards, need a third. But no third O card with R. So can't make three same colors for O.

Alternatively, colors all different. For O cards, if we take Card1 (R), Card2 (P), Card3 (G). So numbers: 2,1,2. Not same or different. So numbers are invalid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, looking for different shapes. So with Card1 (O), find two other cards with D and S.

Let's try Card1 (O2RS), Card5 (D3GH), Card6 (S2RS).

Check attributes:

Shapes: O, D, S. All different. Good.

Numbers:2,3,2. Not same or different. So invalid.

Shading: S, H, S. Two S and one H. Invalid.

How about Card1, Card5, Card8 (S2GO).

Shapes: O, D, S. All different. Good.

Numbers:2,3,2. Not same or different.

Color: R (Card1), G (Card5), G (Card8). Two Gs and one R. Not same or different.

Shading: S, H, O. All different. So shading is good. But color and numbers are bad. So invalid.

Another trio: Card1 (O2RS), Card9 (D3RH), Card6 (S2RS).

Shapes: O, D, S. All different. Good.

Numbers:2,3,2. Not same or different. So invalid.

Alternatively, Card1 (O2RS), Card7 (D2GO), Card8 (S2GO).

Shapes: O, D, S. Good.

Numbers:2,2,2. Same. Good.

Color: R (1), G (7), G (8). Two Gs, one R. Not same or different.

Shading: S, O, O. Two O and one S. Not same or different. So invalid.

Hmm. Maybe this is too time-consuming. Let me try another method. Let's check some known sets.

Looking at the bottom row, card 12 is O3GS. Maybe check if there's a set with 3 and 12. Both O and G. Let's see if adding another O card with different attributes.

Card3: O2GS (2, G, S)

Card12: O3GS (3, G, S)

So numbers are 2 and 3. Need a third card with number 1 to have all different. Color is G, so need all same or different. Since both are G, the third should also be G. Shading is S, so third must be S. So looking for an O1GS. But in the cards, O1 cards are 2 (O1PH) and 10 (O1PO). Neither is G. So can't form a set here.

Alternatively, maybe different color. If we have two Gs, the third must be G as well. So maybe not possible.

How about card 5, 7, 9. Let's see:

Card5: D3GH

Card7: D2GO

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: All D. Good.

Numbers:3,2,3. Not same or different. So invalid.

Hmm. Let's look for a set where all attributes are different. For example, each attribute is different.

Take cards 2,5,8.

Card2: O1PH (Oval,1,Purple,Hashed)

Card5: D3GH (Diamond,3,Green,Hashed)

Card8: S2GO (Squiggle,2,Green,Outlined)

Shapes: O, D, S. All different. Good.

Numbers:1,3,2. All different. Good.

Colors: Purple, Green, Green. Not all different. Two Greens. So invalid.

Another trio: 2,5,10.

Card2: O1PH

Card5: D3GH

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: O, D, O. Not all different.

Numbers:1,3,1. Not all different.

So invalid.

How about 4, 8, 12.

Card4: S1GO

Card8: S2GO

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: S, S, O. Not all same or different.

Numbers:1,2,3. All different.

Colors: G, G, G. All same.

Shading: O, O, S. Not same or different.

So some attributes meet, but others don't. Invalid.

Another trio: 6,7,9.

Card6: S2RS

Card7: D2GO

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: S, D, D. Not all same or different.

Numbers:2,2,3. Not same or different.

Colors: R, G, R. Not same or different.

Shading: S, O, H. All different.

But since other attributes don't meet, invalid.

Let me think of another approach. Let's look for trios where all four attributes are either all same or all different. For example:

Cards 5 (D3GH), 6 (S2RS), 10 (O1PO).

Let's check each attribute:

Shape: D, S, O. All different. Good.

Number:3,2,1. All different. Good.

Color: G, R, P. All different. Good.

Shading: H, S, O. All different. Good.

Wow, this seems to work! All attributes are all different. So this trio (5,6,10) would be a valid set.

Let me confirm:

Card5: D3GH

Card6: S2RS

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: D, S, O → all different.

Numbers:3,2,1 → all different.

Colors: G, R, P → all different.

Shading: H, S, O → all different.

Yes! So that's one set.

Another possible set: cards 2, 8, 12.

Wait:

Card2: O1PH

Card8: S2GO

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: O, S, O → two O's, one S. Not all same or different. So invalid.

How about cards 2, 6, 10.

Card2: O1PH

Card6: S2RS

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: O, S, O → invalid.

Hmm. Let's check another possible set. Cards 1, 5, 9.

Card1: O2RS

Card5: D3GH

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: O, D, D → Not same/different.

No.

Another trio: 3, 6, 9.

Card3: O2GS

Card6: S2RS

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: O, S, D → all different.

Numbers:2,2,3 → not same/different.

Colors: G, R, R → not same/different.

Shading: S, S, H → not same/different.

So invalid.

Wait, what about cards 1, 6, 11.

Card1: O2RS

Card6: S2RS

Card11: O2RH

Shapes: O, S, O → invalid.

Another thought: maybe check the three hashed cards. Cards with shading H:

Card2: O1PH

Card5: D3GH

Card9: D3RH

Card11: O2RH

So four cards. Let's check any three.

Take 2,5,9.

Shading H: all same. Good.

Shapes: O, D, D → not same/different.

Numbers:1,3,3 → not same/different.

Colors: P, G, R → all different. Good.

But shape and numbers are not compliant. So invalid.

Another trio from H: 5,9,11.

Card5: D3GH

Card9: D3RH

Card11: O2RH

Shading: H, H, H. Same.

Shapes: D, D, O → not same/different.

Numbers:3,3,2 → not same/different.

Colors: G, R, R → not same/different.

So invalid.

How about cards 2,9,11.

Shading H: same.

Shapes: O, D, O → not same/different.

No.

Another trio: 4,7,10.

Card4: S1GO

Card7: D2GO

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: S, D, O → all different.

Numbers:1,2,1 → not same/different.

Colors: G, G, P → not same/different.

Shading: O, O, O → same. But numbers and colors are invalid.

Hmm. Let's think of another possible set. Cards 7,8,9.

Card7: D2GO

Card8: S2GO

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: D, S, D → not same/different.

Numbers:2,2,3 → not same/different.

Colors: G, G, R → not same/different.

Shading: O, O, H → not same/different.

Nope.

Wait, another possible set I found earlier: 5,6,10. That's valid. Are there others?

Let me check another trio: 2,3,4.

Card2: O1PH

Card3: O2GS

Card4: S1GO

Shapes: O, O, S → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,1 → invalid.

How about 3,4,12.

Card3: O2GS

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: O, S, O → invalid.

Numbers:2,1,3 → all different. Good.

Colors: G, G, G → all same. Good.

Shading: S, O, S → two S and one O. Invalid.

So invalid.

Another possible set: 7,8,12.

Card7: D2GO

Card8: S2GO

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: D, S, O → all different.

Numbers:2,2,3 → invalid.

Colors: G, G, G → same. Good.

Shading: O, O, S → two O and one S. Invalid.

Hmm. Another approach: Check for all same shading. Let's look at shading S. Cards with S:

1,3,6,12.

So four cards. Let's check combinations.

1,3,6: O2RS, O2GS, S2RS.

Shapes: O, O, S → invalid.

Numbers:2,2,2 → same. Good.

Colors: R, G, R → invalid.

Shading: all S. Good.

But colors are not all same or different. So invalid.

1,3,12:

Shapes O, O, O → same. Good.

Numbers 2,2,3 → invalid.

Colors R, G, G → invalid.

Shading S, S, S → same. Good.

But numbers and colors are invalid.

1,6,12:

Shapes O, S, O → invalid.

Numbers 2,2,3 → invalid.

Colors R, R, G → invalid.

Shading S, S, S → same. But other attributes fail.

Card7: D2GO

Shapes: S, D, D → invalid.

Numbers:1,3,2 → all different.

Card7: D2GO

Card8: S2GO

Shapes: D, D, S → invalid.

Numbers:3,2,2 → invalid.

Colors: G, G, G → same. Good.

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: O, D, O → invalid.

Numbers:2,3,1 → all different.

Shapes: S, S, S. Same. Good.

Numbers:1,2,2 → invalid.

Colors: G, R, G → invalid.

Shading: O, S, O → invalid.

Hmm. Let's check the trio 5, 6, 10 again. Confirmed earlier that all attributes are different. Yes, that's a valid set.

Is there another set? Let's see. How about 2, 5, 8.

Card2: O1PH

Card8: S2GO

Shapes: O, D, S → all different.

Hmm. Let's check if there's a set with all same number. For example, number 3: cards 5,9,12.

Card5: D3GH

Card9: D3RH

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: D, D, O → invalid.

Numbers:3,3,3 → same. Good.

Card5: D3GH

Card8: S2GO

Shapes: O, D, S → all different.

Numbers:1,3,2 → all different.

Shapes: O, S, O → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,1 → invalid.

Colors: P, G, P → invalid.

Shading: H, O, O → invalid.

How about cards 5, 6, 10. Wait, that's the set we found earlier. Let's see if there's another one.

Looking at cards 3, 6, 9.

Card3: O2GS

Card6: S2RS

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: O, S, D → all different.

Numbers:2,2,3 → invalid.

Colors: G, R, R → invalid.

Shading: S, S, H → invalid.

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: D, S, O → all different.

Numbers:2,2,1 → invalid.

Card11: O2RH

Shapes: S, D, O → all different.

Numbers:2,3,2 → invalid.

Colors: R, R, R → same.

Shading: S, H, H → invalid.

So colors are same, others are not compliant.

Another possible set: 2, 7, 12.

Card2: O1PH

Card7: D2GO

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: O, D, O → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,3 → all different.

Card8: S2GO

Shapes: O, D, S → all different.

Numbers:2,3,2 → invalid.

Colors: G, G, G → same.

Shading: S, H, O → all different.

So numbers are invalid.

Wait, numbers: 2,3,2 → two 2s and one 3. Invalid.

Hmm. Let's think of the set 5,6,10 and see if there are others. Maybe another set where all attributes are all different. Let's look for another trio where each attribute is different.

How about cards 2, 6, 7.

Card2: O1PH

Card6: S2RS

Card7: D2GO

Shapes: O, S, D → all different.

Numbers:1,2,2 → invalid.

Colors: P, R, G → all different.

Shading: H, S, O → all different.

But numbers are invalid. So no.

Another trio: 4, 9, 10.

Card5: D3GH

Shapes: O, S, D → all different.

Numbers:2,1,3 → all different.

Colors: G, G, G → same.

Shading: S, O, H → all different.

So colors are same. So this would work for shape (all different), number (all different), color (all same), shading (all different). Wait, but each attribute must be all same or all different. So for color, since all are G, that's valid. For shape, all different. Number, all different. Shading, all different. So this trio would form a valid set.

Wait, let's check:

Card3: O2GS (O,2,G,S)

Card4: S1GO (S,1,G,O)

Card5: D3GH (D,3,G,H)

Shapes: O, S, D → all different. Good.

Numbers:2,1,3 → all different. Good.

Colors: G, G, G → all same. Good.

Shading: S, O, H → all different. Good.

Yes! So this trio (3,4,5) is a valid set.

Okay, so that's another set.

Let me verify:

- Shape: All different (O, S, D).

- Number: All different (1,2,3).

- Color: All same (G).

- Shading: All different (S, O, H).

Each attribute meets the criteria. So this is a valid set.

Card11: O2RH

Shapes: D, S, O → all different.

Numbers:3,2,2 → invalid.

Shading: H, O, H → invalid.

No.

Let me check if there's another set where all attributes are all same or all different. For example, cards 3, 4, 5 we found. Are there others?

How about 9, 10, 11.

Card9: D3RH

Card10: O1PO

Card11: O2RH

Shapes: D, O, O → invalid.

Numbers:3,1,2 → all different.

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: all O. Good.

Numbers:1,2,3 → all different.

Colors: P, R, G → all different.

Shading: O, H, S → all different.

Numbers:1,2,3 → all different. Good.

Colors: Purple, Red, Green → all different. Good.

Shading: Outlined, Hashed, Solid → all different. Good.

Card8: S2GO

Shapes: S, D, S → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,2 → invalid.

Colors: G, G, G → same. Good.

Shading: O, O, O → same. Good.

So shapes: two S and one D → invalid.

Another trio: 1, 5, 11.

Card1: O2RS

Card5: D3GH

Card11: O2RH

Shapes: O, D, O → invalid.

Numbers:2,3,2 → invalid.

Shapes: S, D, S → invalid.

Numbers:1,3,2 → all different.

Colors: G, G, R → invalid.

Shading: O, H, S → all different.

No.

Hmm. Let me check if there's a set with all same color, say Purple. Cards with Purple:

Card2: O1PH

Card10: O1PO

So only two. Can't form a set.

Red color: cards 1,6,9,11.

Check if any three form a set.

1,6,9:

Card1: O2RS

Card6: S2RS

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: O, S, D → all different.

Numbers:2,2,3 → invalid.

Colors: R, R, R → same. Good.

Shading: S, S, H → invalid.

Numbers and shading are invalid.

1,6,11:

Shapes: O, S, O → invalid.

Numbers:2,2,2 → same.

Shading: S, S, H → invalid.

So invalid.

1,9,11:

Shapes: O, D, O → invalid.

Numbers:2,3,2 → invalid.

Colors: R, R, R → same.

Shading: S, H, H → invalid.

Another possible set: 6,9,11.

Shapes: S, D, O → all different.

Numbers:2,3,2 → invalid.

Colors: R, R, R → same.

Shading: S, H, H → invalid.

No.

Green color: cards 3,4,5,7,8,12.

We already found the set 3,4,5. Maybe another set within green.

Check 5,7,8.

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: O, S, O → invalid.

Numbers:2,2,3 → invalid.

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: D, S, O → all different.

Numbers:3,2,3 → invalid.

Card7: D2GO

Card8: S2GO

Shapes: S, D, S → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,2 → invalid.

Colors: G, G, G → same.

Shading: O, O, O → same.

So shading and colors are same. Numbers and shapes invalid.

So shapes are not all same or different.

Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Let's look for trios where three attributes are all different and one is all same.

For example, shapes all different, numbers all different, colors all same, shading all different. Like the set 3,4,5.

Another example: shapes all same, numbers all different, colors all different, shading all different. Like 10,11,12.

Are there any others with this pattern?

Let's check cards 2, 7, 10.

Card2: O1PH

Card7: D2GO

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: O, D, O → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,1 → invalid.

Colors: P, G, P → invalid.

Shading: H, O, O → invalid.

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: O, S, O → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,1 → invalid.

Colors: P, R, P → invalid.

Shading: H, S, O → all different.

But shapes and numbers are invalid.

Hmm. Let me recap the sets I've found:

1. 3,4,5: Shapes different, numbers different, color same, shading different.

2. 5,6,10: All attributes different.

3. 10,11,12: Shapes same, others different.

Are there any others?

What about cards 2, 3, 4.

Card2: O1PH

Card3: O2GS

Card4: S1GO

Shapes: O, O, S → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,1 → invalid.

No.

Another possible set: 7, 8, 11.

Card7: D2GO

Card8: S2GO

Card11: O2RH

Shapes: D, S, O → all different.

Numbers:2,2,2 → same. Good.

Colors: G, G, R → invalid.

Shading: O, O, H → invalid.

No.

Another trio: 6, 7, 12.

Shapes: S, D, O → all different.

Numbers:1,3,1 → invalid.

Colors: G, G, P → invalid.

Shading: O, H, O → invalid.

No.

Okay, after checking various combinations, I think the three sets found are the only ones.

To summarize:

1. Cards 3, 4, 5: Shapes (O, S, D), Numbers (2,1,3), Colors (G, G, G), Shading (S, O, H).

2. Cards 5, 6, 10: All attributes different.

3. Cards 10, 11, 12: All Ovals, with other attributes all different.

Wait, let me check card 10: O1PO (Oval, 1, Purple, Outlined)

Card11: O2RH (Oval, 2, Red, Hashed)

Card12: O3GS (Oval, 3, Green, Solid)

Shapes: All O.

Numbers:1,2,3 → all different.

Colors: Purple, Red, Green → all different.

Shading: Outlined, Hashed, Solid → all different.

Yes, that's a valid set.

Are there any other sets?

I think I might have missed one. Let me check cards 1, 2, 3.

Card1: O2RS

Card2: O1PH

Card3: O2GS

Shapes: all O.

Numbers:2,1,2 → invalid.

Colors: R, P, G → all different.

Shading: S, H, S → invalid.

So invalid.

Another possible set: 5, 8, 9.

Card5: D3GH

Card8: S2GO

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: D, S, D → invalid.

Numbers:3,2,3 → invalid.

Colors: G, G, R → invalid.

Card11: O2RH

Shapes: D, D, O → invalid.

Numbers:3,2,2 → invalid.

Colors: G, G, R → invalid.

Shading: H, O, H → invalid.

No.

I think that's all. So the valid sets are:

- 3,4,5

- 5,6,10

- 10,11,12

Wait, but wait. Let me check if there's another set in the top row.

Cards 1,3,12.

Card1: O2RS

Card3: O2GS

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: all O.

Numbers:2,2,3 → invalid.

Colors: R, G, G → invalid.

Card9: D3RH

Shapes: O, S, D → all different.

Numbers:2,2,3 → invalid.

Colors: R, G, R → invalid.

Shading: S, O, H → all different.

Wait, cards 4, 8, 12.

Card4: S1GO

Card8: S2GO

Card12: O3GS

Shapes: S, S, O → invalid.

Numbers:1,2,3 → all different.

Colors: G, G, G → same.

Shading: O, O, S → invalid.

So numbers and colors are good, but shapes and shading invalid.

No.

Another trio: 2, 3, 10.

Card2: O1PH

Card3: O2GS

Card10: O1PO

Shapes: all O.

Numbers:1,2,1 → invalid.

Colors: P, G, P → invalid.

Shading: H, S, O → all different.

No.

Okay, I think I've exhausted the possible combinations. The valid sets are:

1. Cards 3, 4, 5

2. Cards 5, 6, 10

3. Cards 10, 11, 12

Let me verify each once more.

Set 3,4,5:

- Shape: O, S, D → all different.

- Number:2,1,3 → all different.

- Color: G, G, G → all same.

- Shading: S, O, H → all different.

All attributes comply.

Set 5,6,10:

- Shape: D, S, O → all different.

- Number:3,2,1 → all different.

- Color: G, R, P → all different.

- Shading: H, S, O → all different.

All attributes comply.

Set 10,11,12:

- Shape: O, O, O → all same.

- Number:1,2,3 → all different.

- Color: P, R, G → all different.

- Shading: O, H, S → all different.

All attributes comply.

Yes, these three sets are valid.
