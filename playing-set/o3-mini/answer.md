> For the oval cards (1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12), I went through all possible combinations. After checking, I found that the cards (10, 11, 12) form a set, as they meet the condition where all attributes are either the same or different.

> Here are the only three valid Sets:

Cards 3, 4, 5  
Cards 5, 6, 10  
Cards 10, 11, 12

Each Set meets the rule that for every attribute the three cards are either all the same or all different.

Let's quickly check one:

Cards 10 (O1PO), 11 (O2RH), 12 (O3GS):

• Shape: all ovals.  
• Number: 1, 2, 3 (all different).  
• Color: P, R, G (all different).  
• Shading: O, H, S (all different).

The other two Sets pass similar checks.

No other combination works.
