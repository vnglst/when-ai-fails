> I’m looking at how the Set game cards are represented in shorthand. The notation goes: [Shape][Number][Color][Shading].

> Now with "O1PH," I see it's an Oval (O), 1 of them, in Purple (P), with Hashed shading (H). I’m just double-checking the consistency of the shading description, since "hashed" is noted as H. It’s a little tricky, but I think I have it!

> Looking at card 7, "D3GO" is shorthand for Diamond, 3, Green, Outlined. But the description says "Two outlined green diamonds," which doesn't match. Hmm, the shorthand seems clearer than the description, so I’ll trust that. It’s likely a mistake in the description.

> I’ll check card 8, and it has the same issue: "S3GO" means Squiggle, 3, Green, Outlined, but the description says "Two outlined." This pattern suggests descriptions are inconsistent, but shorthand is probably correct. I'll stick with the shorthand interpretation for now.

Below are five valid Sets found in the layout:

• Card 2, Card 6, Card 7  
• Card 3, Card 4, Card 5  
• Card 5, Card 6, Card 10  
• Card 5, Card 8, Card 12  
• Card 10, Card 11, Card 12

Each Set meets the rule: for every attribute, the three cards are either all the same or all different.
