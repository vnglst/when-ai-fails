# Mistral (Le Chat, unknown model)

## Using Python / tools

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Define the cards with their attributes

cards = [
"O2RS", # Card 1
"O1PH", # Card 2
"O2GS", # Card 3
"S1GO", # Card 4
"D3GH", # Card 5
"S2RS", # Card 6
"D2GO", # Card 7
"S2GO", # Card 8
"D3RH", # Card 9
"O1PO", # Card 10
"O2RH", # Card 11
"O3GS" # Card 12
]

# Function to check if three cards form a Set

def is_set(cards): # Check each attribute
for i in range(4): # If all are the same or all are different
if len(set(card[i] for card in cards)) not in [1, 3]:
return False
return True

# Find all possible Sets

sets = [
(cards.index(a) + 1, cards.index(b) + 1, cards.index(c) + 1)
for a, b, c in combinations(cards, 3)
if is_set([a, b, c])
]

sets
```

```python
[(3, 4, 5), (5, 6, 10), (10, 11, 12)]
```

To identify all possible Sets in the given layout, we need to check each combination of three cards to see if they satisfy the Set criteria: for each attribute (shape, number, color, shading), the cards must either all have the same attribute or all have different attributes.

Let's go through the process of identifying these Sets.The possible Sets in the given layout are:

1. Cards 3, 4, and 5
2. Cards 5, 6, and 10
3. Cards 10, 11, and 12

These sets satisfy the condition that for each attribute, the cards must all have the same attribute or all different attributes.
