# Mistral (Le Chat, unknown model)

## Without using tools/Python

To identify all possible Sets in the given layout, we need to check each combination of three cards to see if they form a valid Set. A Set is valid if, for each of the four attributes (Shape, Number, Color, Shading), the three cards are either all the same or all different.

Let's analyze the cards step by step:

### Card Attributes:

1. O2RS: Oval, 2, Red, Solid
2. O1PH: Oval, 1, Purple, Hashed
3. O2GS: Oval, 2, Green, Solid
4. S1GO: Squiggle, 1, Green, Outlined
5. D3GH: Diamond, 3, Green, Hashed
6. S2RS: Squiggle, 2, Red, Solid
7. D3GO: Diamond, 3, Green, Outlined
8. S3GO: Squiggle, 3, Green, Outlined
9. D3RH: Diamond, 3, Red, Hashed
10. O1PO: Oval, 1, Purple, Outlined
11. O2RH: Oval, 2, Red, Hashed
12. O3GS: Oval, 3, Green, Solid

### Valid Sets:

1. **Cards 1, 2, 11**:

   - Shape: All Oval
   - Number: All different (2, 1, 2)
   - Color: All Red
   - Shading: All different (Solid, Hashed, Hashed)

2. **Cards 1, 3, 12**:

   - Shape: All Oval
   - Number: All different (2, 2, 3)
   - Color: All Green
   - Shading: All Solid

3. **Cards 2, 10, 11**:

   - Shape: All Oval
   - Number: All different (1, 1, 2)
   - Color: All Purple
   - Shading: All different (Hashed, Outlined, Hashed)

4. **Cards 4, 6, 7**:

   - Shape: All different (Squiggle, Squiggle, Diamond)
   - Number: All different (1, 2, 3)
   - Color: All Green
   - Shading: All different (Outlined, Solid, Outlined)

5. **Cards 5, 8, 9**:

   - Shape: All different (Diamond, Squiggle, Diamond)
   - Number: All 3
   - Color: All different (Green, Green, Red)
   - Shading: All different (Hashed, Outlined, Hashed)

6. **Cards 6, 7, 8**:
   - Shape: All different (Squiggle, Diamond, Squiggle)
   - Number: All different (2, 3, 3)
   - Color: All Green
   - Shading: All different (Solid, Outlined, Outlined)

These are the valid Sets from the given layout.
