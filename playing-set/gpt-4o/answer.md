# GPT-4o

To identify all possible Sets, we examine each attribute across three cards: shape, number, color, and shading. A valid Set requires that each attribute be either all the same or all different.

### Identified Sets:

1. **(Card 1, Card 3, Card 12)**

   - O2RS, O2GS, O3GS
   - Shape: All O (same)
   - Number: 2, 2, 3 (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

2. **(Card 2, Card 10, Card 11)**

   - O1PH, O1PO, O2RH
   - Shape: All O (same)
   - Number: 1, 1, 2 (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

3. **(Card 5, Card 7, Card 8)**

   - D3GH, D3GO, S3GO
   - Shape: D, D, S (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

4. **(Card 5, Card 6, Card 9)**

   - D3GH, S2RS, D3RH
   - Shape: D, S, D (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

5. **(Card 1, Card 6, Card 9)**

   - O2RS, S2RS, D3RH
   - Shape: O, S, D (all different)
   - Number: 2, 2, 3 (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

6. **(Card 2, Card 4, Card 12)**

   - O1PH, S1GO, O3GS
   - Shape: O, S, O (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

7. **(Card 3, Card 4, Card 5)**

   - O2GS, S1GO, D3GH
   - Shape: O, S, D (all different)
   - Number: 2, 1, 3 (all different)
   - Color: G, G, G (all same)
   - Shading: S, O, H (all different)
   - **Valid Set → (Card 3, Card 4, Card 5)**

8. **(Card 6, Card 9, Card 11)**

   - S2RS, D3RH, O2RH
   - Shape: S, D, O (all different)
   - Number: 2, 3, 2 (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

9. **(Card 2, Card 10, Card 12)**

   - O1PH, O1PO, O3GS
   - Shape: All O (same)
   - Number: 1, 1, 3 (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

10. **(Card 7, Card 8, Card 12)**

- D3GO, S3GO, O3GS
- Shape: D, S, O (all different)
- Number: 3, 3, 3 (all same)
- Color: G, G, G (all same)
- Shading: O, O, S (not all same, not all different) → **Not a Set**

### Confirmed Sets:

- **(Card 3, Card 4, Card 5)**
