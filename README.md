# When AI Fails

**When AI Fails** is a project dedicated to documenting the funny, interesting, and sometimes outright stupid ways in which AI can fail. Despite the advancements in artificial intelligence, there are still many scenarios where AI systems produce unexpected or incorrect results. This project aims to highlight these instances and provide insights into the limitations and challenges of AI.
